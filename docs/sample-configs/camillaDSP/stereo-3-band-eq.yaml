# /docs/sample-configs/camillaDSP/stereo-3-band-eq.yaml
#
# This configuration provides a standard 3-band stereo equalizer (EQ)
# with controls for Low, Mid, and High frequencies. It is intended for
# a normal stereo setup and does NOT perform a crossover.
#
# Adjust the 'gain' parameter on each filter to boost or cut frequencies.
# - Positive gain (e.g., 3.0) boosts the frequency range.
# - Negative gain (e.g., -2.5) cuts the frequency range.
# - A gain of 0.0 has no effect.

  # --- 3-Band EQ Filters ---

  # Low Frequency Control (Bass)
  # A Lowshelf filter affects all frequencies below its 'freq' value.
  Low_EQ:
    type: Biquad
    parameters:
      type: Lowshelf
      freq: 250     # Affects frequencies below 250 Hz
      gain: 0.0     # Adjust this value to boost/cut bass
      q: 0.7        # A gentle slope

  # Mid Frequency Control
  # A Peaking filter affects frequencies centered around its 'freq' value.
  Mid_EQ:
    type: Biquad
    parameters:
      type: Peaking
      freq: 1500    # Affects frequencies around 1500 Hz (1.5 kHz)
      gain: 0.0     # Adjust this value to boost/cut mids
      q: 1.0        # A medium-width band

  # High Frequency Control (Treble)
  # A Highshelf filter affects all frequencies above its 'freq' value.
  High_EQ:
    type: Biquad
    parameters:
      type: Highshelf
      freq: 5000    # Affects frequencies above 5000 Hz (5 kHz)
      gain: 0.0     # Adjust this value to boost/cut treble
      q: 0.7        # A gentle slope

pipeline:
  # Apply the EQ filters to both Left (0) and Right (1) channels.
  # The order doesn't matter here as they operate on different frequencies.
